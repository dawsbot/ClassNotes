###Netcat Connecting
    nc www.google.com 80

    GET / HTTP/1.0
    <newline>

OR

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    HOST: www.google.com
    <newline>

Google uses closed source **GWS** (Google Web Server) instead of:
* Apache
* NginX
* etc.

###Netcat Opening port
    nc -l -p 9001
    //Binds to address 0.0.0.0:8088

*Any IP staring with 10 means it's an internally NATted address*

Our Kali VM **can** ssh out and into the **also NATted** local box
We **cannot** ssh out in the other direction (from Mac to Kali)
In other words, **Kali can only see out**

    /etc/hosts
Used to be DNS (not scalable, so we now use DNS instead)
