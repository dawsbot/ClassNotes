# Day 3

#### Why did the US go to war with Iraq?

We need not be focused on the US & Iraq, this is a **timeless question**

## Why do states fight wars?

Three I's:

1. Interests: Issues arrise when actors do not know what other **actors want**.
2. Interactions
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
    * Cooperation: Interactions that make atleast one actor better off without making the others worse off (Splitting which creates value for both)

    * Bargaining: Interactions that make one actor better off at the expense of the other (Splitting something with fixed value)
      </tr>
    </td>
  </table>

3. Institutions: What was the context in which the relevant actors interacted?

    * The deal structure offered by the DA for the prisonners
    * Traffic light

##Prisoner's Dilemma
* If neither rat out their partner, they pay no time & split the $
* If both rat out their partner, they both pay time & split the $
